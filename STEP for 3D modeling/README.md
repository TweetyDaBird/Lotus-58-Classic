### STEP files used for 3D modeling cases etc.
All relevant components are modeled and present on both sides of the PCB, as they are not always 100% symmetrical (placement depends on traces etc). Keep in mind that the modeling should as standard use the component placed on the bottom side of the PCB for each respective hand.
